# rmate

If you wish to activate TextMate from an ssh session you can do so by copying the `rmate` (ruby) script to the server you are logged into. The script will connect back to TextMate running on your Mac so you should setup an ssh tunnel (as your Mac is likely behind NAT):

	ssh -R 52698:127.0.0.1:52698 user@server

# Usage

	rmate <file>

Call `rmate --help` for options. Default options can be set in `/etc/rmate.rc` or `~/.rmate.rc`, e.g.:

```yaml
host: auto # use 'localhost' with ssh tunnel
port: 52698
```
You can also set the `RMATE_HOST` and `RMATE_PORT` environment variables.
